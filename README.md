# basic-bot
The intent of this bot is to serve as a simplistic bot to enhance a personal Discord server with basic features such as:
- [x] Fetching top 10 news articles from Kotaku
- [ ] Post a meme of the day reaching out via Reddits API

I am creating this bot using the `discord.js` npm package to expedite use of the Discord API.

## Goals
I intend to use this to learn typescript in a slighly different context, rather than a backend REST API.
